# UW-WSU_Introduction_to_Structured_Decision_Making
This is a repo for the winter 2023 course Introduction to Structured Decision Making, offered jointly at University of Washington and Washington State University. See the detailed syllabus in the repo - I will post specific and up-to-date course content here. 

## Course Description 

Managing natural resources requires making decisions; in fact, one of the hardest parts of management is deciding what to do to improve conditions for natural resources and the people who rely on them. Decision science is a broad field of inquiry that focuses on both how people make decisions in practice (descriptive decision science) and how people can make decisions more effectively (normative decision science). The application of decision science, known as decision analysis or structured decision making (SDM), offers both a philosophy regarding how to think through decisions and a vast set of tools for framing, structuring, solving, implementing, and revisiting decisions. Increasingly, SDM is a vital part of natural resource management, with agencies using SDM to guide a wide variety of decisions at a range of spatiotemporal scales. This course will provide students with an understanding of the fundamentals of SDM, and will take a deeper dive into a variety of topics, including predictive modeling, multiple objective tradeoffs, risk, value of information, and dynamic or adaptive decisions.
